# Todo:

- [ ] tables
- [ ] table unpacking
- [ ] tuples (separate from arrays):
  - the syntax would look something like:
    ```
    (x = some value, y = some other value, ...)
    ```
  - it would act like a combination of an array and a table:
    - ie, `tuple.x` would be the same thing as `tuple[0]` in the given example
  - this way, you have both the readability of returning an object,
    but also the ease of use of just returning an array
